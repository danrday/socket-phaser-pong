### About Socket Phaser Pong

Our app is a built on a Node.js server, and a rebuild of the classic arcade game Pong.
The game play is built with Phaser, an HTML5 game framework.

Players can either choose from a single player mode, or two player mode. The game play for multiplayer mode is updated in real time with Socket.io.
